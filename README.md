# num_to_words
*** This is a task given by Kalvium ***

This program takes a number as input and converts it to words. It first checks the length of the input number and if it is greater than 4 or if the length is 0, it returns an error message. It then defines four arrays for the single digits, two digits, tens multiples, and tens power. It then uses these arrays to convert the input number to words by checking the length of the input number and then processing it accordingly. Finally, it prints the output in words. The program is written using the Java programming language.
